There are a variety of C/C++ libraries that can be accessed on the CSIL systems, or installed on your own systems.

Typically, the header files (`.h`) files live in `/usr/include` and the libraries that you link with live in `/usr/lib`.

* On MacOS systems, you can install many of these packages with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
* On Windows, one option to install many of them is [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
