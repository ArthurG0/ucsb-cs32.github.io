According to the web page <https://cairographics.org/>:

<blockquote>
Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window System (via both Xlib and XCB), Quartz, Win32, image buffers, PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output. Experimental backends include OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.
</blockquote>

For a simple Hello World style program with a Makefile that should compile on CSIL (though it doesn't as of 02/06/2018, and we are hoping to get that remedied), see:
